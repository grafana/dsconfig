_Last updated: 2026-07-06 · generated from o11y-bench job `anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6-off-k3`_

Benchmark of an LLM agent on the `datasource_config` task category (creating, editing, and explaining Grafana datasources via mcp-grafana tools).

## Summary

| Model | Tasks | pass^3 (consistent) | pass@3 (any) | Mean score | Cost | Steps/trial |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sonnet 4.6 | 21 | 4/21 (19%) | 11/21 (52%) | 78% | $2.59 | 2.8 |

- **pass^3** — task passes only if *all* 3 attempts pass (strict consistency).
- **pass@3** — task passes if *any* of 3 attempts pass.
- **Mean score** — average per-trial score (0–100%) across all trials.

### Notes

- `edit-*` tasks (modifying an existing datasource) are the strongest — several pass consistently across all 3 attempts.
- `add-*` tasks (creating a datasource from scratch) are the weakest; none pass^3, with the agent frequently stalling at information-gathering instead of committing the `create_datasource` call.
